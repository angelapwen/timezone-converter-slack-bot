if userMessage contains (:  or xpm or xam or xp.m. 
or xa.m.) then prompt user about timezone conversion, ie 
"do you want to this time converted to your timezone?"

if userMessage contains (timejunk) and has a different user tagged, then convert timezone to original users timezone (using a timezone convert function) and send as a message. "9:00 pm for Tim is 11:00 pm for you, Will"

timezone convert function 
{ 
get timezone of user who was tagged using users.info (which takes as params
the AUTH token and user ID of the user)


get timezone of user who sent message using users.info

if timezones are different, calculate the difference and add (using positive or negative value) in hours (will require convert from seconds) the value to the sending user's time. 
i.e. "what time is 9:00 pm for @tim?" 
difference in timezones = 120
inHours =  120 / 60 
"9:00 pm for Tim is 11:00 pm for you, Will"

}
