Pseudocode for Scenario 1, using the skeleton code from Starterbot:

Main function:
	If connected, print on console "Timezone bot running"
	Find timezonebot's ID and save
	Call parse_bot_commands
		Return command, channel, event_ts, calling_user
	If command:
		Call handle_command
	Else 
		Print connection failed
		
parse_bot_commands:
	Takes in parameters of slack_events
	If event type is message, call parse_direct_mention_message
	Save user_id (the user who was mentioned)
	Save the rest of message into variable message
	If user_id = timezonebot ID
		Return message, channel, thread timestamp, and user who sent the original message (calling_user)
		
parse_direct_mention_message:
	Takes in message_text from parse_bot_commands
	Returns the username, and then the rest of the message
	
handle_command:
	Default response = "Hi User ID " + calling_user + " Sorry, I didn't understand that. 
		Please repeat your request by using the following format:
		@TimezoneBot What time is 9:00pm for @Tim?"
	
	Otherwise--
	If message begins with "What time is"
		Call parse_timezone_message
			Find the time in message, the user in message
			
			If message parses correctly,
				Call timezone_convert
					Find the timezone offset and timezone_name_final of user_in_message
					Find the timezone offset and timezone_name_original of calling_user

					Use time_in_message, user_in_message, the timezone offset of user in message, 
					the timezone offset of calling_user to find the converted_time for the calling_user
				
				Response = time_in_message + timezone_name_original "for " user_in_message 
						" is " final_time + timezone_name_final " for you, " calling_user
			
			If message doesn't parse correctly,
				Response = "Hi User ID " + calling_user + " Sorry, I didn't understand that. 
				Please repeat your request by using the following format: 
				@TimezoneBot What time is 9:00pm for @Tim?"
	
	Send the response to the appropriate channel by replying to thread 
	
	
Other things to think of and add in:
	Bot call was not worded correctly
	calling_user did not set timezone on Slack
	user_in_message did not set timezone on slack
	working with AM and PM
	Need to add dates or something
	Need to change calling_user and user_in_message from ID #s to the actual username or name


	
	
	
	

SCENARIO 1 (Possibly can be completed with just Python, slackclient):

if userMessage calls @TimezoneBot
	if it contains another time and has a different user tagged
		then call timezoneConvert
		send original time, otherUser, finalTime, yourUser as a reply to message (in a thread)
	else the message calls @TimezoneBot but did not contain the correct syntax
		send error message to user in ephemeral message 
		"Sorry, I didn't understand that. Please repeat your request by using the following format:
		@TimezoneBot 9:00pm for @Tim?"

eg. Will: "@TimezoneBot 9:00pm for @Tim?"
	Call timezoneConvert, returns finalTime
	Print original time, otherUser, finalTime, yourUser
TimezoneBot: "9:00pm for Tim is 11:00pm for you, Will"

eg2. Angela: "@TimezoneBot What time is Paul's workshop at 10am tomorrow?"
TimezoneBot: "Sorry, I didn't understand that. Please repeat your request by using the following format:
		@TimezoneBot 9:00pm for @Tim?"




SCENARIO 2 (May need JSON and ngrok for Message Buttons and formatting):

if ':' in userMessage, check values to left and right of ':'
		if values are ints, ______
			then prompt all other users in channel about timezone conversion, ie 
				"do you want to this time converted to your timezone?"
					YES | NO
				if YES,
					Call timezoneConvert
					Print original time, otherUser,finalTime, yourUser in an EPHEMERAL message
						only visible to user
					TimezoneBot: "9:00pm for Tim is 11:00pm for you, Will"
				if NO,
					Display instructions for using TimezoneBot
					"Okay, noted. Next time, if you would like to see another Slack user's time in your 
					time zone, simply type '@TimezoneBot #:##am/pm for @OtherUser' and you will receive
					a private message."
					
					
def timezoneConvert
{ 
get timezone of user who was tagged using users.info (which takes as params
the AUTH token and user ID of the user)

get timezone of user who sent message using users.info 

if timezones are different, calculate the difference and add (using positive or negative value) in hours (will require convert from seconds) the value to the sending user's time. 

user1Timezone = -23880 
user2Timezone = -24000
difference in timezones = otherUserTimezone - yourUserTimezone
inHours =  difference / 3600

finalTime = originalTime + difference

return finalTime

}
