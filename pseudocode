if userMessage contains ( ':'  or xpm or xam or xp.m. 
or xa.m.) then prompt user about timezone conversion, ie 
"do you want to this time converted to your timezone?"
	if ':' in userMessage, check values to left and right of ':'
		if values are ints, ______

if userMessage contains (timejunk) and has a different user tagged, then convert timezone to original users timezone (using a timezone convert function) and send as a message. "9:00 pm for Tim is 11:00 pm for you, Will"

def timeZoneConvert
{ 
get timezone of user who was tagged using users.info (which takes as params
the AUTH token and user ID of the user)


get timezone of user who sent message using users.info

if timezones are different, calculate the difference and add (using positive or negative value) in hours (will require convert from seconds) the value to the sending user's time. 


i.e. "what time is 9:00 pm for @tim?"
user1Timezone = -23880 
user2Timezone = -24000
difference in timezones = user1Timezone - user2Timezone
inHours =  120 / 60 
"9:00 pm for Tim is 11:00 pm for you, Will"

}
